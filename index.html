                <p>Voting is an important civic duty we have as American citizens.  The Fifteenth Amendment to the US Constitutional says that "[t]he right of citizens of the United States to vote shall not be denied or abridged by the United States or by any State on account of race, color, or previous condition of servitude."</p>
                </br>
                <p class="second-par">When you vote, you are an active participant influencing the present and the future by contributing your position on ideas and ideals and supporting candidates that you feel will best represent your interests.  If you vote, you can take comfort in the fact that you play a role in the betterment of the political system.  </p>

                        <p>First, you have to verify your voter registration and locate your specific polling place.  Once that location is found, go to the polls and give your name to the inspector and sign the poll roster book.  You will then receive the paper ballot.  Next, cast your vote.  There are several different types of machines that are available in New York depending on the county you where you are registered to vote.  If at any time you need help casting your vote, feel free to ask a poll inspector if you need assistance. You may be assisted by any person of your choice including a trained poll worker, but you are not permitted to obtain assistance from your employer or union representative
